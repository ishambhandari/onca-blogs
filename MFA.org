* Importance of Multi-factor authentication

Security has become a primary concern for individuals and enterprises. Cybercriminals employ various techniques to gain unauthorized access to accounts and systems. One of the most popular one is just by stealing your login information. The process of logging in is called "authentication" where you are proving to the service that you are who you say you are. This is usually done by providing a user name and a password.

Multi-factor authentication is a multi step login process that requires the user to enter more information than just a password. For example, a user might be asked to enter a OTP (One time pin) or a code that is either sent their email or phone number etc. Another example for MFA would be to provide something you have like a token or smart card and finally something you are like your biometric data, finger prints or facial scans.
This process helps to prevent malicious users from getting into your account even if the password has been compromised.

One other important thing to know is that people tend to worry about whether this is going to be massively inconvinient. Usually, you don't have to do the second step very often, it is only used for the first time you signed in the new devices or if you change your password. Depending upon the chosen method, MFA implementation for companies might incur some additional charges for hardware and software liscence but lack of MFA could result in a catastrophe within the organization from data leaks to ransomware. In the last five years, four major breaches involving 550 million records could have been stopped by using multi-factor authentication.

The demand for MFA is fuelled by growing identity thefts and breaches. The Multi-factor authentifcation market size was valued at 12.9 billion USD in 2022 and is projected to reach 26.7 billion USD by the end of 2027.
